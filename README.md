# Scrivendo

## Overview

This app departs from two main ideas. The first is an idea I had about telling
and retelling the same story over and over and watching it evolve over time,
and the second is a parable about growing skills in two different ways. The
parable goes like this: once there were two pottery classes. The first of these
was told that they had the semester to make one pot as well as the possibly
could and they would be judged on the merits of whatever pot they finally
submitted. The second class was told that they would be judged on the number of
pots that they made. The takeaway is usually that the second way is the better
way to learn.

Scrivendo allows users to tell and retell their stories, with the goal of
learning something new with each retelling of the story. Over time, the hope
is that this will help writers start to see which parts of stories are really
important, and also which ways of telling stories they are more comfortable
using. Scrivendo will also allow users to make and receive suggestions about
retelling stories in different styles or with focus on different events.

Having seen what a huge effect giving people meaningless points on the internet
has, I intend to gamify the site a bit on two spectrums: writing and criticism.
I think being able to see at a glance how valuable a critic's input has been
will allow a writer to filter out bad criticism more quickly, and it will
encourage critics to be more thoughtful and careful.
